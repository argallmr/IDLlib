; PURPOSE:
;+
;   Parse the Help, /LAST_MESSAGE report. The traceback will begin at the
;   line at which the last error occurred, and propagate back through the
;   callstack.
;
;   Output format is:
;       "In ROUTINE at (line ###)"
;   or
;       "In ROUTINE at (line ###) --> [filename]"
;
; :Params:
;       CALLER:      out, optional, type=string
;                    Name of the calling program in which the error occurred.
;       LINE:        out, optional, type=string
;                    Line at which the error occurred in `CALLER`.
;
; :Keywords:
;       ADD_FILES:   in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;                    If set, the names of the files in which the routines are saved
;                        will be included in the traceback report.
